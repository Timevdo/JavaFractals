Final Project, AP Computer Science 2020. "Program that Generates Fractals in Java"

For the most complete product, run the main() method of GUI.java
The GUI currently supports generating Julia Sets with any complex parameter C, either in Color or in Black & White.
Use the mousewheel to zoom, and drag to move the fractal around

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set for more information

Koch Snowflakes and other fractals were originally meant to be a part of the program, but have since been removed. Code that generates Koch Snowflakes has been marked as deprecated
