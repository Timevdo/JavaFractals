Prototype Version, 2020-06-03

For the most complete product, run the main() method of GUI.java
The GUI currently supports generating Julia Sets with any complex parameter C

Koch Fractals are not currently implemented into the GUI, to see the best working Koch Fractal, run the main() method of KochFractal.java

It is not yet decided whether the final product will feature Koch Fractals, as they are pretty boring compared to Julia Sets
